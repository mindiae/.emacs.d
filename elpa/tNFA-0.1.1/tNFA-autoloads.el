(autoload 'tNFA-from-regexp "tNFA" "\
Create a tagged NFA that recognizes the regular expression REGEXP.
The return value is the initial state of the tagged NFA.

REGEXP can be any sequence type (vector, list, or string); it
need not be an actual string. Special characters in REGEXP are
still just that: elements of the sequence that are characters
which have a special meaning in regexps.

The :test keyword argument specifies how to test whether two
individual elements of STRING are identical. The default is `eq'.

Only a subset of the full Emacs regular expression syntax is
supported. There is no support for regexp constructs that are
only meaningful for strings (character ranges and character
classes inside character alternatives, and syntax-related
backslash constructs). Back-references and non-greedy postfix
operators are not supported, so `?' after a postfix operator
loses its special meaning. Also, matches are always anchored, so
`$' and `^' lose their special meanings (use `.*' at the
beginning and end of the regexp to get an unanchored match).

\(fn REGEXP &key (TEST \\='eq))" nil nil)

(autoload 'tNFA-regexp-match "tNFA" "\
Return non-nil if STRING matches REGEXP, nil otherwise.
Sets the match data if there was a match; see `match-beginning',
`match-end' and `match-string'.
